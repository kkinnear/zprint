# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. 

## 1.2.5 - 2022-08-03

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

## 1.2.4 - 2022-08-02

### Added

  * You can now alias one funtion in the `:fn-map` to another. The
  key is (as always) the function name as a string, and the value is
  another function name, also as a string.  Thus `{:fn-map {"mydefn" 
  "defn"}}` will cause the function "mydefn" to be formatted however
  "defn" is formatted. Issue #234. 

  * `{:list {:nl-count <n>}}` to add additional newlines in lists.
  (Part of Issue/Discussion #236)

  * Hiccup and HTML output now available from all library fns that
  end with `-str`, and the prebuilt binaries.  Use `{:output {:format
  :hiccup}}` or `{:output {:format :html}}` to get this type of
  output.  This is a new, capability, ALPHA quality for now. Note
  that you can adjust the `paragraph` output in the HTML. The current
  default is `{:output {:paragraph {:style 
  "font-size:20px;font-family: Lucidia Concole, Courier, monospace"}}}`.
  Issue/Discussion #214.

  * Another way to prevent justification of things that will look
  bad. In addition to `{:pair {:justify {:max-variance 20}}}` there
  is now the, perhaps easier to understand, `{:pair {:justify
  {:max-gap n}}}`, where n is maximum number spaces which will show
  up between the left and right columns of a bunch of pairs being
  justified.  Note that the `:max-gap` is calculated after the
  `:no-justify` and `:ignore-for-variance` elements are removed.
  So if you want them included when calculating the `:max-gap`, you
  need to adjust these parameters as well. Issue #239.

  * There are pairs in functions like `cond`, in maps, and in bindings.
  When the right hand part of the pair doesn't fit, it "flows" onto the
  next line.  A new feature is now available to flow all of the right
  hand pairs onto the next line if any of them flow because they don't
  fit.  This will certainly make things take more vertical space, but
  the additional consistency may make the pairs more easily distinguishable.
  You can enable this in any of the three possible places by setting
  `:flow-all-if-any? true` in `:pair`, `:map`, or `:binding`.
  Issue #235.

  * EXPERIMENTAL: Every function type is now looked up in the `:fn-type-map`.
  The value of the function type is the same as the value of the keys in
  the `:fn-map` -- either a function type, or a vector containing a function
  type and an options map.  In most cases you don't want one function type
  to simply alias another, so the usual value of a key in the `:fn-type-map`
  would be a vector containing a function type and an options map to be used
  when this function type is encountered.  Note that this is EXPERIMENTAL
  and may well be removed.  Note also that you cannot define your own
  function types -- the only allowed keys in the `:fn-type-map` are the
  existing, known, function types.

### Changed

  * Upgraded to newer `rewrite-clj`, and changed `edn*` to `of-node*` to
  remove deprecation warnings.  Issue #247.

### Fixed

  * Namespaced maps don't work with `:style :indent-only`: the namespace
  goes missing! Issue #242.

  * Indent on anonymous fns is wrong with `:style :indent-only`.  Issue #243.

  * `{:meta {:split? true}}` doesn't properly handle multiple `^:stuff` 
  metadata elements.  It leaves someout.  Issue #245.

## 1.2.3 - 2022-04-13

### Added

  * New `:range` configuration options: `:use-previous-!zprint?` and
  `:continue-after-!zprint-error?`.  These allow someone doing `:range`
  formatting on a file (string) which has `;!zprint` formatting directives
  to have the lines in the range formatted the same when doing just the 
  range or the whole file.  `:use-previous-!zprint?` if true will scan
  all previous `;!zprint` directives prior to formatting the range.
  `:continue-after-!zprint-error?` if true will ignore errors in
  any `;!zprint` directives, and output any errors in the map 
  returned by `:output {:range? true}`.

  * An alternative way to format metadata was created.  It is 
  `:style :meta-alt`.  It is presently experiemental.  Issue #224.

### Changed

  * The `:fn` function type didn't handle multi-arity functions well.
  Now they flow instead of hanging.

### Fixed

  * Removed obsolete underscore from docs and specs.  Issue #220.

  * `letfn` didn't indent its fns like fns.  Now it does.  And if they
  are multi-arity, the various arities don't hang, but rather flow.
  Issue #221.

  * Several tests failed when running with new version of `planck`, and
  therefore new version of Clojurescript.  Now they don't.  Issue #222.

  * The styles `:community` and `:rod` didn't compose, because `:guided`
  was not considered a "body" function type.  Now they do.
  Issue #223.

  * `zprint-file-str` was not thread-safe, for a variety of reasons.
  Now it is, and configuration is thread-safe as well.  Issue #226.

  * A function with `:binding` function type would cause an NPE if
  it had no binding vector.  That is, `(let)` would not format successfully.
  Now it is fine.  Issue #230.

  * Figured out Figwheel issues. Rebel-readline uses rewrite-cljs, which
  conflicts with rewrite-clj V1. To use rebel-readline: 
  `com.bhauman/rebel-readline-cljs {:mvn/version "0.1.4" :exclusions [rewrite-cljs/rewrite-cljs]}` 
  Issue #231.

## 1.2.2 - 2022-02-11

### Added

  * Added `"defn-"` to style `:rod` (which previously modified only
  `"defn"`).
  
### Fixed

  * Fixed problem with complex `:style` configurations, where styles
  specified in a vector (in order to all be used) didn't configure
  properly if they also specified multiple styles if a vector.
  Issue #217.


## 1.2.1 - 2022-01-26

### Added

  * Added the capability to get "real" newlines (or whatever line endings
  are used) in strings. `{:output {:real-le? true :real-le-length 20}}`
  controls this, with "real" line endings replacing the escaped versions
  (e.g "\n") in strings whose length is equal or greater than 
  `:real-le-length`, which defaults to 20.  This should __only__ be used 
  when creating output as opposed to formatting code.  Issue #38.

  * Added a new capability to recover the adjusted range and formatted
  output for just that range when using `{:input {:range {:start n
  :end m}}}`.  If you also include `{:output {:range? true}}` the
  return is a vector with: `[{:range {:actual-start s :actual-end
  t}} "..."]` where the "..." is the formatted output for the range
  of `:actual-start` to `:actual-end` in the string (file) input
  to `zprint-file-str`. This is important because zprint will always
  expand the given `:start` and `:end` to encompass entire top-level
  expressions.  Using `{:output {:range? true}}` allows you to
  recover the expanded range that zprint used, as well as just the
  formatted lines for that range.  If the `:actual-start` and
  `:actual-end` are both -1, that signals that no formatting was
  performed, the string (the second thing in the vector) is replaced
  by `nil`.  This will occur when the input range included only
  lines for which no formatting was possible, typically blank lines
  or lines with only comments.  The purpose of this capability is
  to ease integration of zprint into an extension for an editor or
  an IDE.  You can pass in the start and end without regard to
  whether or not they encompass entire top level expressions, and
  zprint will figure out how to expand them to cover the minimally
  correct number of lines beyond the start and end.  Using `{:output
  {:range? true}}`, zprint will tell you the lines that it figured
  out, and will return just the formatted output related to those
  lines.  Note that the `:actual-start` and `:actual-end` refer to
  lines in the input file (string).  The number of lines encompassed
  by the `:actual-start` and `:actual-end` will, in general, not
  be the same as the number of lines in the string returned as the
  formatted output.  It will certainly be related, but may be larger,
  the same, or smaller.  Were you to use this capability to integrate
  with an editor or IDE, you would replace the lines `:actual-start`
  through `:actual-end` in the input document with the formatted
  output returned in the string.
  
### Changed

  * Enhanced the processing for the experimental `:rod` ("Rules of
  Defn") style to allow similar processing except for not having
  blank lines between multiple arities in a function.  New style:
  `:rod-no-ma-nl`, which stands for "rules-of-defn no multi-arity
  newline".  Issue #170.

### Fixed

  * Fixed problem in formatting of `are` expressions. There were two
  problems, where some expressions wouldn't format with the correct number
  of columns, and the columns were usually too wide as well.  Issue #212.

  * Fixed issue where the local `abs` function conflicted with the new
  `abs` function added to Clojure 1.11.0-alpha4.  Issue #215.

## 1.2.0 - 2021-11-18

### Added

  * `{:map {:key-value-options {key-1 options-map-1 key-2 options-map-2 ...}}` 
  lets you specify an options map to be used for formatting the value
  of any specific key in a map.  I first conceived of this as a way to solve
  some request in an issue from a good while ago, but I can't seem to find
  which issue it was, for which I aplogize to whomever triggered this 
  capability!

  * `{:vector {:force-nl? true}}` will cause a vector to never format
  on a single line, even if it would fit.  Also, `{:list {:force-nl? true}}` 
  will do the same for lists.  There has been growing desire for something
  like this, and Issue #184 pushed me into actually implementing it.

  * `{:list {:wrap? true}}` will cause a list to wrap just like vectors
  do by default.  You can this this for a function using the `:wrap` 
  function type, but now you can get it for lists in general as well.

  * New styles: `:require-macros-justify` and `:import-justify`, as well as
  `:ns-justify` that includes both of them together with the existing
  `:require-justify`.  Each of the `-justify` styles has an associated style:
  `:rj-var`, `:rjm-var`, and `:ij-var` which allows you to change the
  `:max-variance` for justification separately for each by redefining
  them as changes to the `:style-map`.  Issue #166.

  * New style: `:quote-wrap`, to be used where you want quoted lists
  to wrap (like vectors) and not trail down the page as lists will do
  by default.  Issue #175.
  
### Changed

  * Problem with loss of spaces preceding inline comments at the
  top level.  This turns out to be a bigger problem of multiple
  things on the same line at the top level.  This fix for this
  entire problem now causes all of the expressions encountered by
  `zprint-file-str` at the top level to begin on a new line, as
  they have always done when using `parse-string-all` in the library.
  This is a behavior change for `zprint-file-str` (which is the
  basis of the standalong binaries), but of a behavior that is
  broken yet which has never been reported.  If this change in
  behavior is a problem for you, please create an issue and we will
  figure something out.  I could make this new behavior configurable
  if necessary, but didn't want to do that unless required, as there
  are already plenty of configuration options. Issue #191.

  * Now using a very new version of the parser `rewrite-clj` for both
  Clojure as well as Clojurescript.  The integration testing went very
  well.  That said, be alert for subtle changes resulting from this 
  major change.

  * Made style `signature1` part of the standard definition for 
  `defprotocol`.  This now prints different arities on separate
  lines.  If you like it more compact (i.e., the way it was before
  this change), then define this for `defprotocol`:
  `{:fn-map {"defprotocol" [:none-body {:style :defprotocolguide}]}}`.
  Issue #181.

### Fixed

  * Expressions containing an empty list `()` are missing when using
  `{:style :indent-only}`.  This a serious problem, and is now fixed.
  Issue #209.

  * Documentation error in getting zprint for Linux. Testing the result
  with `-e` is wrong, now you test it with `--explain-all`.   Part of 
  Issue #101.

  * Fixed problem where user defined fn was declared :arg2-extend, and
  then zprint threw an exception when formatting data that was not
  "extend like".  Issue #200.

  * Fixed `:quote` to change indent to 1.  Issue #175.

  * `##NaN`, etc, now work.  Used new parser! Many thanks to @lread
  for stepping up to support rewrite-clj and merging rewrite-cljs with
  it! Issue #153.

  * Fixed a failure when using `:range`, if one of lines specified fell
  on an unevaluated expression, things didn't work.  Issue #190.

  * Namespaces maps don't work in rewrite-clj v0, but now they do since
  we moved to v1.  Issue #199.

  * `zprint -e` was incorrectly documented as a way to test an installation.
  Issue #201.

  * Didn't want to print a vector on one line, even though it fit.  Added
  `:vector {:force-nl? true}` to prevent this.  Issue #184.

  * Fixed problem with `:style :hiccup` affecting code formatting inside
  a vector.  Issue #204.

  * Fixed a problem where `:style :keyword-respect-nl` threw an exception
  when encountering a vector like: `[#_a 1]`, because the first thing in
  the vector wasn't something that could be passed to option-fn-first.
  Issue #206.


## 1.1.2 - 2021-5-2

### Added

  * There was a request to justify the column after the namespaces
  in a `:require` clause of the `ns`.  This can make any file which
  requires a lot of namespaces look pretty nice: `:style
  :require-justify`.  Presently this is experimental, but it won't
  be going away, it just might change slightly as more people use
  it and it improves.  The `:max-variance` it uses is `20` and comes
  from `:style :rj-var`. It can be changed thus: `{:style
  :require-justify :style-map {:rj-var {:pair {:justify {:max-variance
  n}}}}}` to use n as a max-variance for just the `:require-justify`.
  You can also use `:style :require-pair`, which is similar but
  doesn't include justification.  It is also implemented entirely
  differently, so if something odd happens with `:style :require-justify`
  then `:style :require-pair` is a likely fallback. Issue #166.

  * Maps with an odd number of values (i.e., unbalanced pairs) can
  cause problems with some advanced features of zprint.  Now, by
  default, maps where the odd value is `...` will work, and any map
  with a key equal to `...` will not be sorted.  This enables zprint
  to format maps which have been output with a `...` to represent
  elements not present.  Two new sets have been added to support
  this behavior.  `{:parse {:ignore-if-parse-fails #{"..."}}}` is
  a set in which you can put things that show up as single elements
  in a map, and which will be removed for internal processing but
  will still show up in the output.  In addition, `{:map {:key-no-sort
  #{"..."}}}` is a set of strings that are matched against keys in
  a map, and if any of them match the string representation of any
  keys in a map, that map will not be sorted.  Issue #188.

  * An experimental style to format `defn` forms differently.
  `{:style :rod}` is a first cut at someone's particular "rules of defn".
  The output is likely to change a bit, but if you try it and prefer this to
  the normal `defn` output, please let me know (and include what you
  like about it).  Issue #170.

### Changed

  * Changed how quoted lists are handled.  Previously a quoted list
  was handled like a regular list, where it was assumed to be code,
  and formatted with elements appearing the function position that
  appear in the `:fn-map` using the supplied fn-type.  For elements
  not appearing in the `:fn-map`, the second argument was placed
  on the same line as the first, and subsequent arguments were
  placed beneath the second if possible.  Now, because of the default
  configuration of `:quote` in the `:fn-map`, quoted lists are not
  considred "in-code", and the `:fn-map` is ignored when formatting
  a quoted list.  In addition, the elements in the list are flowed
  with an `:indent` of 1.  Any maps in the list will have their
  keys sorted, since by default maps allow sorting of keys when not
  in-code.  If you would like quoted lists to wrap (as vectors do
  by default), you can use `:style :quote-wrap`.  If you prefer to
  not have quoted lists handled any differently then they are today,
  you can configure `{:fn-map {:quote :none}}` in an options map,
  and receive the current default behavior.  Issue #175.

  * zprint now recognizes that any keywords in the "local" position (i.e.,
  left hand side) of binding vector pairs are likely part of the
  "better cond" macro.  They are now processed together, which only
  really makes a difference if you are trying to force the value
  expressions onto separate lines from the locals, in that it will
  not force the right-hand-sides of these better-cond expressions
  to the next lines.  Issue #178.

  * Justification has changed considerably, resulting in minor but
  significant changes to the default behavior. The new approach to justification
  looks at the variance of the lengths of the left-hand-sides of whatever
  pairs are attempting to be justified, and will only justify them if the
  variance is below the configured `:max-variance`, which is separately
  configurable for maps, binding vectors, and pairs.  In addition, it will
  leave out up to two different lengths of left-hand-sides and justify the
  remaining rows of pairs if that will bring the variance below the maximum
  allowed.  You can set the variance for `:map`, `:binding`, and `:pair` by
  setting `{:binding {:justify {:max-variance 20}}}` or any other number
  besides 20 that you want.  This works as above `:map` and `:pair` as well
  as `binding`.  If you want the previous justification approach, you can use
  `{:style :justified-original}` which sets the `:max-variance` to `1000`
  for `:binding`, `:map`, and `:pair`, yielding the previous behavior.
  You might find that justification is a lot more visually pleasing now
  with this more nuanced approach. Issue #179.

  * The `comment` function now will not hang its arguments. If you wish to
  return to the previous approach, use `{:fn-map {"comment" :none}}`.
  Issue #182.

  * By default any map with a key "..." will not be sorted as part
  of changes for Issue #188.  If you wish a return to the previous
  behavior, include this in your options map: `{:remove {:map
  {:key-no-sort #{"..."}}}}`.

  * It happens that `reset!` wasn't in the `:fn-map`.  Since it is like
  `swap!`, which is `:arg2`, made `reset!` `:arg2` as well.

  * The `are` function previously didn't format any differently than
  any other function, which made it particularly unreadable.  Now
  the `are` function is formatted as requested in Issue #81.

### Fixed

  * `:interpose` was not successfully configured from `~/.zprintrc` or local
  `.zprintrc` files when using pre-built binaries or the uberjar. Issue #186.

  * You can now have `:next-inner` inside of a `:next-inner`.  Issue
  #185.

  * `defprotocol` and `defrecord` are now "body" functions, which means
  that the indentation of the forms does not change from 2 to 1 when using
  `:style :community`.  Issue #176.

  * `defprotocol` formatting has been extended to properly handle
  the changes in Clojure 1.10, where `:extend-via-metadata true` is
  allowed after the component name.  Issue #181.

  * Loss of comments inside meta-data expressions.  Issue #187.

## 1.1.1 - 2021-1-20

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

  * In a very obscure case, requiring use of {:list {:respect-nl?
  true}}, and a hanging final parenthesis, a very short, unnamed
  anonymous function would disappear. This is clearly a very serious issue
  despite the number of specific conditions required to provoke it. Issue #173.

## 1.1.0 - 2021-1-16

### Added

  * Documentation for `brew install --cask zprint`.  Pull request #161.

  * Several new, simpler, and clearer examples in the community documentation.
  Issue #165.

  * New options `:nl-separator-all?` for `:binding`, `:map`, and `:pair`.
  These are similar to `:nl-separator?`, but where `:nl-separator?` will
  place a blank line after a pair only when the right element of the pair
  was placed on the line below the left element, `:nl-separator-all?` will
  always place a blank line after every pair, regardless of where the right
  element of the pair ended up.  There are also new styles `:binding-nl-all`,
  `:map-nl-all`, and `:pair-nl-all` which can be used to configure this 
  approach for the respective elements (and set `:indent 0` so it looks like
  you probably expect).  :Issue #165.

  * You can now define a style by changing the `:style-map` and invoke
  (i.e. utilize) the style in the same `.zprintrc` or the same call
  to `set-options!`.

  * Several new switches and variants of the existing `-w` and `--write` 
  switches on the distributed pre-built binaries and the uberjar. 
  You can now "check" files (without changing them) with the `-c` and `--check`
  switches.  Both the `-c` and `-w` switches can take modifiers, shown
  here modifying the `-w` switch (and they work with `-c` as well):

    - `-lw` like `-w`, but indicate which files processed
    - `-fw` like `-w`, but indicate which files changed
    - `-sw` like `-w`, but include a summary of the number of files processed and how many required a format change, as well as any errors

  You can combine these, as in `-lfsw` as well.
  See [here](./doc/using/files.md) for full details, or type 
  `zprint -h` for help.

### Changed

  * Type hint in `redef.cljc` to allow library build in graalVM 20.2.0.
  Pull request #171.

  * The `-e` and `--explain` switches on the pre-built binaries and the
  uberjar will now only report the vales in the options map that 
  differ from the defaults.  If you wish to see the entire options map,
  you can use `--explain-all`.

  * The distributed, pre-built binaries now will not replace an existing
  file with an unchanged file when using the `-w` (`--write`) switch,
  or any of its variants (see above).  Previously they re-wrote the input 
  file with the formatted output regardless of whether or not it changed.
  Now they do not write unchanged data back into the file.

  * In Issue #124 we added the ability to have inline functions defined
  in some `.zprintrc` files, but not all of them.  In addition, the
  graalVM binarie didn't support function definitions at all in any
  `.zprintrc` files.  Now you can define functions in any `.zprintrc`
  files, regardless of the binary you are using.  This is not a 
  security issue because the inline function definitions are defined
  and executed with the "Small Clojure Interpreter", `sci`.  In addition,
  these `.zprintrc` files will work in the pre-built graalVM binaries.

  * The `:flow` function type (in the `:fn-map`) now supports constant
  pairing.

  * The `:moustache` style has been split into two part and changed to
  include justification for the pairs.

  * Changed the `:fn-map` for `defexpect` to use `:style :respect-nl` only
  at the top level of the `defexpect`.

### Fixed

  * Error found but not reported in `.zprintrc` and `.zprint.edn` files
  found with `:search-config? true`.  Issue #167.

  * Fixed two subtle hang flow problems, Issue #163.

  * Cleaned up `:fn-map` entries for `->` and `->>` to not allow constant
  pairing at the top level of these functions, since they may well have
  keywords listed as functions.  It is still enabled down a level inside 
  either function. Issue #164.

## 1.0.2 - 2020-11-10

### Added

  * A new swtich for the uberjar and pre-built binaries: `-w` and `--write`.
  This performs in-place formatting, reading the file, formatting it, and 
  re-writing it in place.  It will work for one file or a set of file.
  For instance: `$ zprint -w *.clj` will format all of the `.clj` files
  in the current directory.  If any of the files have errors, the contents
  of that file are left unchanged, an error is written to stderr, and
  the exit-status is set to 1.  This runs faster (possibly much faster)
  than `lein zprint`, and does essentially the same thing. Issue #159.

  * A new style: `:dark-color-map`, which sets both the `:color-map` and
  the `:uneval {:color-map ...}` to new colors which may not be your favorites,
  but are at least visible with a dark terminal theme.

  * You can now change the things considered "constant" for constant-pairing.
  If you configure a one argument function as the value of `:constant-pair-fn`,
  it will be called with something to determine if it is a "constant", and
  therefore should be paired up.   In this way, you can alter the pairing
  behavior of constant-pairing.  Issue #56.

  * A new style, `:moustache`, which adds vectors to the elements to be
  paired by constant-pairing for the function `app`.  Issue #56.

### Changed

  * Once again, changed `project.clj` dependency and profile organization
  to try to keep the generated `pom.xml` something that `cljdoc` can
  digest successfully.

### Fixed

  * If a file doesn't format correctly (perhaps because of a mal-formed
  ;!zprint directive), the file is unchanged, the error is sent to stderr,
  and the exit-status is 1.  Issue #160.

  * All standard line endings (e.g., `\n` `\r\n` and `\r`) are now 
  fully supported in all aspects of zprint. The line ending is determined
  by what zprint sees in the first 2000 characters of the string or file.
  Issue #150.

## 1.0.1 - 2020-9-22

### Added

  * Integrated new color map capabilities developed by @RingMan.  
  Now, many more colors are available (including background colors),
  and you can now combine ANSI color values for additional flexibility.
  Additionally, you can now set the colors for: `:char`, `:comma`, `false`,
  `:regex`, `:symbol`, and `:true`.
  Issue #140, #152..

  * Default function formatting -- you can now place a key in the
  `:fn-map` of `:default`, and the function-type (and possible
  options map) will be used for any function which does not have
  an explicit function-type set in the `:fn-map` or whose function-type
  in the `:fn-map` is `:none`.

### Changed

  * Changed from classic expectations testing framework, to 
  development version of `expectations.clojure.test` after porting it to
  Clojurescript.

  * `{:map {:lift-ns? false}}` -- the default for `:map :lift-ns?` was
  changed to false from true, largely because formatting `deps.edn` files
  looks ugly when the `:mvn` is lifted out.  An alternative would have
  been to only lift a namespace out of a map if there were more than
  one key.  Please submit an issue if you feel strongly about this one
  way or the other and we can discuss it.

  * Changed default `:max-depth` and `:max-length` to be 1000000
  instead of 1000, as the `defexpect` in `zprint_test.cljc` had
  more than 1000 `expect` entries in it!

  * Changed `:fm-map` for `defexpect` to have `:style :respect-bl` so
  that blank lines between `expect` clauses are preserved.

### Fixed

  * Fixed problem with `{:input {:range {:start ... :end ...}}}`
  and how it interacts with `{:parse {:interpose ...}}`.  The
  `:interpose` affects blank lines, and the range specification
  gathered unspecified and inconsistent blank lines at the start
  and end of the range.  Now the range will have no blank lines at
  the start or end of a range (unless it is the start or end of the
  file), making its integration with `:interpose` much clearer.
  Issue #154.

  * When formatting structures (not code), `(nil nil)` would output
  only `()`.  Fixed.  Issue #150.

  * Fixed comments `.zprintrc` files.  Issue #151.

  * Fixed several small bugs in Clojurescript formatting now that
  more complete Clojurescript tests are easily available:
    - inline comments sometimes don't line up
    - indent-only commas missing
    - namespaced maps formatting differently in cljs from clj

  * Fixed problem with negative start range, depending on end of range
  could throw exception.  Also, now if start and end of range are in
  the same gap between expressions, nothing is formatted.  Related
  to Issue #154 above. 

  * Fixed problem where `{:map {:unlift-ns? true}}` was properly distributing
  the namespace among the various keys, but wasn't removing the colons from
  keywords in the process, so that `{:map {:lift-ns? true}}` and `{:map
  {:unlift-ns? true}}` were not opposites.  Now they are.  Issue #156.

## 1.0.0 - 2020-6-8

### Added

  * Support for babashka scripts (or anything with a shebang as
  the first line).  They format correctly, and now you can have
  special configuration for scripts using `{:script {:more-options ...}}`.

  * Formatting supported for ranges of input lines. 
  `{:input {:range {:start ... :end ...}}}` to specify the lines.
  Supported for `zprint-file-str`, uberjar, and precompiled binaries.
  Issue #122.

  * `:style :fast-hang`, which will offer massive formatting speed-up
  for deeply nested code and structures, at the cost of output
  that takes a few more lines than classic zprint formatting and, rarely,
  looks a bit awkward.

### Changed

  * Moved to 1.0.0 per Alex's suggestion.

### Fixed

  * Should comments have special treatment with `{:parse {:interpose "\n\n"}}`.
  Yes, comments with no blank lines after them will never get any additional
  lines from `{:parse {:interpose ...}}`.  Issue #101.

  * Don't output spaces on empty lines.  Now we don't output spaces at the
  end of any lines.  Issue #130.

  * Long comment lines are split when using `:indent-only`.  Now they aren't.
  Issue #131.

  * `:respect-bl` still deletes blank lines from dependencies.  Actually,
  `:respect-bl` has problems with vectors.  Now it doesn't.  Issue #132.

  * Aligned inline comments don't work right with `{:style :respect-nl}`.
  Now they do.  Issue #135.

  * Constant pairing count is fooled by comments, newlines.  Now it isn't.
  Issue #136.

  * Last pair in a map has comment when followed by a comment.  Now it
  doesn't.  Issue #137.

  * Newline ignored when after last map element and `:respect-nl` used.
  Fixed.  Issue #139.

  * `:respect-bl` doesn't work with comments in sets.  Fixed.  Issue #139.

  * Comments missing when in empty list. Fixed.  Issue #141.

  * Inconsistent indent for hanging right close paren/bracket/brace.
  If you have a comment as the last thing in a collection, the closing
  element (paren, brace, bracket) goes by itself on the next line.  The
  question is -- where should it go on the next line.  After a lot of
  experimentation, decided to put it underneath the opening element.
  See Issue #143 for some examples of why.

  * `zprint-file-str` uberjar, and binaries all drop all but one trailing
  newline.  Now all newlines at the end are saved.  Issue #144.

  * Reader conditionals don't work right with `:indent-only` and `:respect-nl`.
  Now they do.  Issue #145.

  * `{:parse {:left-space :keep}}` doesn't work for comments.  Fixed.
  Issue #145.

  * When comment is the last thing in a collection, `:indent-only` adds
  blank line before closing.  Fixed. Issue #149.

## 0.5.4 - 2020-3-21

### Added

  * Significant new capability -- __Respect Blank Lines__.  In the same
  way that `:respect-nl?` has been implemented for lists, vectors,
  maps and sets, now `:respect-bl?` has been implemented for them
  all as well.  This means that whenever a blank line appears in
  the source, it will be "respected", and will appear in the output.
  However, all other formatting will be applied around any blank
  lines that may appear. Issue #125. 
   
  While `:respect-nl?` was something that you might want to configure
  for formatting a single function, `:respect-bl?` is something that
  is perfectly reasonable to configure for processing whole files,
  or perhaps all of the time in your `~/.zprintrc` file. If you
  do that, everything will operate as normal with zprint, but if you
  put blank lines inside a function definition, those blank lines
  will continue to appear in the output.  And all of the information
  will all be formatted correctly around those blank lines. 
 
  There is a new style: `{:style :respect-bl}` to simplify using
  this capability.

  * Configure the uberjar or pre-built graalVM binaries from a URL.
  `--url` will add an options map found at the specified URL to
  other configuration found from the environment (for instance,
  `~/.zprintrc`).  `--url-only` will configure zprint only from an
  options map found at the specified URL.  Thanks to Colin Taylor
  (coltnz) for the idea and the pull request for this feature.  I
  learned a lot about Java manipulation of URLs and other http
  related data from his work.  Issues #117 and #112.

  * The built in pretty printer for Clojure, `clojure.pprint`, will
  backtranslate `(quote a)` to `'a`, `(var a)` to `#'a`, 
  `(clojure.core/deref a)` to `@a` and `(clojure.core/unquote a)` to
  `~a`.  clojure.pprint only does this when printing data structures, (which
  may be code), since that is all it operates on.  Zprint has been
  enhanced to optionally perform this backtranslation when formatting
  structures.  Use `{:style :backtranslate}` to get this behavior, and
  see the definition of that style to see how it was implemented.
  Even if you use `{:style :backtranslate}`, there is no change to the
  way that source is formatted since zprint has been enhanced to 
  distinguish between source and structures in some situations.  You could
  configure zprint to do this backtranslation for source if you wished to,
  though there is not a pre-defined style to enable that operation.
  See the implementation for `{:style :backtranslate}` for a hint for how
  to do this (or open an issue and ask). Issue #121.

  * In some cases, when specifying option maps for remote invocations
  of zprint, boolean `true` and `false` in the  options map turns
  into something other than `true` and `false` when zprint is invoked
  remotely.  For instance, `true` can become `1` in the remove
  invocation, and `false` can become `0`.  This makes it impossible
  to invoke zprint with a reasaonable options map, since both `1
  `and `0` fail to validate as they are not boolean.  Relaxing the
  validation rules would not help, as `0` is never going to be
  `false` for Clojure.
 
  In this (rather obscure) case you could set `:coerce-to-false`
  to the value that you want to be `false`.  If you do this the
  options map you specify will be searched for all values which
  must be boolean.  If they are already boolean (i.e., already
  `true` or `false`), they are not changed.  If they are not boolean,
  then if they equal the value of `:coerce-to-false`, they will be
  set to `false`, and otherwise they will be set to `true`.
 
  In the example above, `{:coerce-to-false 0}` would correctly set
  the various boolean values.  Issue #111.
  
### Changed

  * Two options map keys were previously ignored if specified in an
  options map on the command line: `:cwd-zprintrc?` and `:search-config?`.
  These keys are now examined and used if specified an options map on the
  command line or in a call to `set-options!`.  Issue #120.

  * The `clojure.core` function `assert-args` is now a `:pair-fn`.

### Fixed

  * Fixed an issue when `.zprintrc` file failed to validate when
  `set-options!` was first called, it would be cause zprint to not
  be initialized but no errors would be output.  Now errors are
  output.  Issue #127

  * `:parallel?` was always set to true when running at the REPL
  even if it was explicitly configured `false` in a `.zprintrc`
  file.  Now the value is not changed if there was any explicit
  configuration for `:parallel?`. Issue #128.

  * While functions have been valid configuration inside of options
  maps for some time, they were only valid when configured with
  `set-options!`, as they would not read in properly from `.zprintrc`
  files or the command line.  Now fns can be read in successfully
  from `~/.zprintrc` and from options maps specified on the command
  line when using the uberjar or `lein-zprint`, __but not when using
  the pre-built graalVM binaries that are distributed in the GitHub
  release.__  Functions are never allowed when reading `.zprintrc`
  files not in the `$HOME` directory and in options maps from URLs.
  In these files they are considered errors (in order to allow
  opening up that path with explicit configuration in the future).
  Issue #124.

  * Fixed issue where vectors output using `:respect-nl?` didn't 
  properly handle two newlines not separated by other whitespace.
  Issue #129.


## 0.5.3 - 2019-11-9

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

  * If the style `{:style :respect-nl}` were used, it would not respect
    newlines in a binding vector (e.g., the vector for `let`).  This
    should have been controlled by `{:vector {:respect-nl? true}}`.
    Issue #118.

## 0.5.2 - 2019-11-6

### Fixed

  * Bug in the graalVM binaries: `zprintm-0.5.1 -e` would throw an
    exception.  Issue #116.

## 0.5.1 - 2019-10-29

### Added

  * Now you can force colored output from the zprint-filter (uberjar and
    graalVM binaries) by adding `{:color? true}` to the options map when
    using them.  The resulting output will have ANSI escapse sequences
    embedded in the output, which will result in "colorized" output when
    displayed on a "terminal" which supports ANSI escape sequences.  The
    output will be useless when stored in a file (unless the point is to
    save it for later display on a "terminal").  As part of this
    implementation the `:color?` key will now control color on all of th
    `zprint`, `zprint-*`, `czprint` and `czprint-*` functions.  The
    functions beginning with "c" simply specify `{:color? true}` for you.

    __DO NOT__ place `{:color? true}` in your `$HOME/.zprintrc` file,
    or all of the zprint-filter output (uberjar and graalVM binaries)
    will produce files with embedded ANSI escape sequences!
    
### Fixed

  * Removed internal use of `{:style :spec}` which was itself removed in 0.5.0.
    Issue #115.

  * `(zprint-fn-str)` and `(czprint-fn-str)` didn't add specs to docstring.

## 0.5.0 - 2019-10-19

Because of the considerable changes in this version, moved from
`0.4.x` to `0.5.x`.

### Added

  * Respect New Lines.  `:respect-nl?` has been implemented for lists, maps,
    sets, and vectors.  Also as a style for all of them: `:style :respect-nl`.
    This will ensure that all newlines in the input also appear in the 
    formatted output.  Additional lines may also be added to format more
    correctly or because lines are too long.  Can be used both as a style
    for everything, or more frequently as a style to be used when formatting
    a particular function where one of the existing formatting styles isn't
    quite right.  If you have a function "func" which would be better 
    handled with `:style :respect-nl`, then an options map of
    `{:fn-map {"func" [:none {:style :respect-nl}]}}` will do that for you.
    Issue #75, and partially #71.

  * Indent Only.  Will not remove or add newlines -- will only regularize
    white space while preserving the content of each line.  This is very
    different from classic zprint, and even from `:style :respect-nl`, above.
    It is available individually for lists, maps, sets, and vectors.  It is
    also available as style: `:style :indent-only`, which is the recommended
    way to use it (if you want this capability).  See the documentation for
    details.  It will clean up the indenting and white space, while doing
    little else.   You can do this for a whole file by specifying the options
    map `{:style :indent-only}`, or for a single function (say "func") by
    giving this options map: 
    `{:fn-map {"func" [:none {:style :indent-only}]}}`.

  * Default mode.  Some people wanted a zprint that was not configurable.
    If you give the uberjar (or graalVM binaries) "-d" or "--default" on
    the command line, it will run zprint with no external configuration.  
    The default configuration is what you get, and no other options are 
    read from anywhere.  In particular, the `$HOME/.zprintrc` file is
    __not__ examined, nor is any other external configuration file.
    No matter who runs it, running zprint with "-s" will produce the same
    output from the same input file. 

  * `-v` and `--version` switches.  Issue #94.

  * `-h`, `--help` switches.

  * `-e`, `--explain` switches to output configuration and show where
    any non-default values came from.

  * `:inline-align-style` to align inline comments in one of three ways:
    `:none`, `:aligned`, `:consecutive`.  The default is `:aligned`, where
    if inline comments are aligned on input, it will align them on output
    as long as they aren't separated by more than 5 non-comment lines.
    `:consecutive` aligns inline comments that appear on consecutive lines.
    `:none` doesn't align inline comments beyond what naturally happens.
    Issue #37.

  * `:next-inner` in the options map of a `:fn-map` vector.  This allows you
    to set some configuration for only one level of processing.  See
    the readme section "Altering the formatting inside of certain functions"
    for details.  Implemented to resolve Issues #71 and #86.

  * `:option-fn` and `:fn-format` in `:vector`.  Thanks to some
    creative thinking and clever implementation by @milankinen
    (Matti Lankinen), the formatting available
    when formatting functions in lists is now also available for
    formatting vectors.  He implemented this to allow
    formatting hiccup vectors in a standard and readable way, but
    there are plenty of other opportunities to format vectors in
    useful and clear ways.  A huge thanks to Matti for contributing
    this to zprint.

### Changed

  * If there was an error on the command line, either in the new
    switches (see above), or the options map, the uberjar and graalVM
    binaries used to format the input and report the error after
    formatting.  Now they do not format at all, and just report the
    error.

  * Configuring zprint with environment variables or Java properties has
    been deprecated for a good while, and is now no longer supported.
    As part of this change, the `{:additional-libaries? ...}` key is
    now not supported (or allowed).

  * Removed `{:style :spec}`, since it has been deprecated since
    the relevant spec functions were enhanced to force `{:list
    {:constant-pair-min 2}}`.

### Fixed

  * If you entered: 
```clojure
(;comment
 function this that and the other)
```
    then `function` would not previously have been recognized if
    it was defined in the `:fn-map`.  The "thing" in the first part
    of the list was what was looked up, and if it was a comment,
    that was too bad.  Now zprint will look up only actual symbols,
    not comments (or newlines).

  * If an inline comment wrapped, it would be on a line by itself.
    It would be aligned with the actual inline comment above it.
    But the next time you ran zprint on the file, the wrapped inline
    comment would be seen a a full line comment, and moved (probably
    left) to be where a full line comment should be.  Fixed this,
    so that a comment with nothing else on the line that is aligned
    with an existing inline comment will stay aligned with that
    inline comment.  Issue #67.

  * In vectors, a full line comment could become an inline comment
    because of the way they wrapped.  Fixed this.  Issue #39.

  * Added `(require clojure.string ...)` to spec.cljc.  Issue #109.

  * Removed nested conditional compilation in `core.cljc`.  Issue #110.

## 0.4.16 - 2019-06-12

### Added

### Changed

  * Implemented `:unlift-ns?`.  If this is specified for a map when formatting
  code (the only place it makes sense), a map specified with a namespace
  at the front (e.g., `#:x{:a :b :c :d}` will be formatted with the namespace
  distributed among the keys, as in `{:x/:a :b, :x/:c :d}`. Issue #80.

### Fixed

  * Fixed record output to be something that can also be read back in.
  Replace "/" in record-type with ".".  Issue #105.  

  * Fixed serious bug in handling of pairs with comments: if a comment
  was the last thing in a series of pairs, the following right parens
  would be missing!  Issue #106.

  * Fixed bug in flow indentation underneath things like `"#(...)"`.
  Issue #103.

  * Fixed bug where files that ended with a newline didn't after being
  processed with {:parse {:interpose "\n\n"}}.  Issue #100.

  * Fixed bug where namespaced maps in source code didn't format 
  correctly. Issue #104.

  * Fixed code to correctly detect when running in a REPL and enable parallel
  operation.  It was always enabling parallel operation before, which will
  cause a main program using zprint to not exit correctly unless you call
  (shutdown-agents).  Now it only enables parallel operation automatically
  if you are in a REPL, or if you call `(set-options! {:parallel? true})`.
  Issue #107.

  * Removed LC= from build.zprintm, since that apparently didn't work
  for the macOS version of graalvm.  Issue #96.

## 0.4.15 - 2019-01-14

### Fixed

  * Fixed cljs build warning.

## 0.4.14 - 2019-01-13

### Added

  * New configuration capabilities.  Everywhere zprint looks for
  a `.zprintrc` file, it will also look for a `.zprint.edn` file
  if it does not find a `.zprintrc` file. Issue #83

  * If the `.zprintrc` or `.zprint.edn` file in the `$HOME` directory
  has `:search-config?` set to `true`, zprint will look for a
  `.zprintrc` or `.zprint.edn` file in the current directory, and
  if does not find one there, in that directory's parent, and will
  continue to look in directories up the tree until it either finds
  a configuration file or runs into the root directory.  If
  `:search-confing?` is true, `:cwd-zprintrc` is ignored.
  
  * Major new capability to rewrite zippers during formatting to
  do things like sort dependencies.  This is alpha/experimental,
  which is to say, the capability may go away or change significantly.
  It has had less testing than usual, but has been tested in both
  Clojure and Clojurescript.  You can access this capabiity for
  Leiningen `project.clj` files by using `{:style :sort-dependencies}`.
  Issue #76

  * Information on using Clojure CLI.  Thanks for pull request #82

### Changed

  * Enhanced formattng of `:binding` functions by allowing empty
  body form: `(let [a b c d])`.  This will successfully format as a
  `:binding` form.  Issue #73

### Fixed

  * Wrapped a `dec` function in an `fnil` to avoid an overly enthusiatic
  Clojurescript warning in Clojurescript 1.10.439.  Issue #91.

  * Added build parameter to graalvm binary builds which helps in
  handling a broader character set. Uberjar with JVM worked anyway.

  * Fixed `zprint-file-str` and `{:parse {:interpose "\n\n"}}` which
  interacted badly.  Comments (including ;!zprint comments) would have 
  an extra blank line.  Issue #84.


## 0.4.13 - 2018-11-21

### Changed

### Fixed

  * Fixed exception when formatting complex `:arg2-extend` functions,
    like `defrecord`, which have functions that don't start with simple
    symbols or keywords.  Issue #72.

  * Fixed exception when formatting a parsed map with keys shorter than 2 
    characters.  Doesn't affect structure formatting, just maps that
    show up in strings that we parse (as in formatting source).
    Issue #74.

## 0.4.12 - 2018-11-6

### Changed

  * Allow any number of semicolons when checking for `;!zprint`.
    Thus, `;;!zprint` and `;;;!zprint` also work.

### Fixed

  * Return non-zero exit status from uberjar (and graalvm binaries) if
    it doesn't format correctly or the options map on the command line
    is bad.

  * Place all exception information for the uberjar (and graalvm binaries)
    on stderr, not stdout.

## 0.4.11 - 2018-10-28

### Changed

 * Added zprintm-0.4.11 MacOS zprint filter to release.  Thanks to
   Martin Klepsch for pointing out a "ce" version of graalvm exists
   for MacOS.  Issue #66.

 * Verified correct operation in Clojure 1.10.0-beta3.

 * Moved to rewrite-clj 0.6.1.

 * Added `cond-let` as a `:pair-fn`.

 * Added a bunch of better doc-strings, doc/cljdoc.edn to make doc
   work better with cljdoc.

 * Moved lumo and planck into .cljs files so that they work with cljdoc.

### Fixed

 * Major bug fix, (or enhancement, depending on your viewpoint).  You 
   can now run multiple zprints in the same JVM at the same time, with
   the restriction that they all need to be doing the same 'kind' of zprint,
   either all parsing strings (typically formatting code), or all operating
   on Clojure(script) structures.  Can't mix them.  But you can use
   `pmap` to get zprint-file to operate on a bunch of files at the same
   time (which was the use case that prompted this change).
   Issue #63.

 * Minor bug where `#(` stayed green inside of syntax-quoted structure, 
   instead of turning red like all other parens to.

## 0.4.10 - 2018-7-28

### Changed

 * Put `^:no-doc` in various places to prepare for codox.  Put codox
   configuration in project.clj.

 * Added capability to have a per-project `.zprintrc` file.  If your
   `$HOME/.zprintrc` file has `{:cwd-zprintrc? true}` in its options map,
   then zprint will also look for a `.zprintrc` file in the current working
   directory.

 * Added capability to have an options map associated with a function
   classification.  Support for Issue #46, as well as changes to the
   classification of `defproject`, `s/def`, and `s/fdef`.  The changes
   to `s/def` and `s/fdef` now let specs format correctly by default,
   and the `:spec` style is no longer necessary (but still there for
   compatibility).

 * Added new style `:how-to-ns`, to format `ns` declarations as in
   Stewart Sierra's "How to ns".  Issue #46.

 * Documented how to keep zprint from configuring from a `.zprintrc` 
   file, for those uses where the options should not be affected by
   any local variations: `(set-options! {:configured? true})` must
   be the first use of zprint.

### Fixed

 * Tests now are independent of any `$HOME/.zprintrc` or local
   `.zprintrc`.  

 * Don't close stdout when zprint.main/-main exits, flush instead.
   Fixes use of zprint.main by clj command.  Issue #57.

 * Fixed appcds checking for java version, now it doesn't.
   Issue #54.

 * Fixed extra spaces between newlines when using `(:style :map-nl}`.
   Issue #59.

 * Fixed problem with `#_#_` syntax, where it was missing the second element.
   Issue #58.

 * Fixed some instructions for graalvm -- set script executable, added
   #!/bin/bash to build.zprintm.

## 0.4.9 - 2018-5-14

### Changed

### Fixed

 * Back off to Clojure 1.8, since 1.9 and lein zprint don't agree with
   each other.

## 0.4.8 - 2018-5-13

### Changed

 * Both `:max-length` and `:max-depth` are now offical parts of zprint.
   They are not experimental anymore.

 * Added `{:max-length [n m]}` capability -- different length boundaries
   for different levels.  Sometimes you want to see all of the top
   level keys in a map, and just a little of the complex values.

 * Added ability to set the character for max-depth: `:max-depth-string`
   is default to "##", but could be anything (e.g., "#").

 * Added `match` and `matchm` to the `:fn-map` as `:arg1-pair-body`.  These 
   are from `core.match`.  Issue #50.

### Fixed

 * Removed (:gen-class) from the .cljs version.  Issue #51.

 * `{:max-hang-depth n}` works along with `{:max-hang-count m}` to decide
   to even try to do a hang.  Having these be 3 and 4, respectively,
   makes some maps format faster, but also messes up perfectly reasonable
   maps to the point that they are really just wrong.  So, set
   `:max-hang-depth` to 300 as a default to disable this optimization.
   Issue #48.

 * {:max-length n} didn't work for lists, and had a number of other
   problems that are now fixed.

 * {:max-depth n} also had issues.  In particular, 0 and 1 were
   the same.  Now 0 will print non-collections, but all collections
   are ##.

 * Changed `:community` style to leave `cond->` as `:arg1-pair-body`,
   instead of moving it to `:none-body`.  Issue #49.

 * (zprint nil :explain) would output the options map in color, even
   though it was zprint and not czprint.  Now it doesn't.

## 0.4.7 - 2018-2-19

### Changed

 * Rewrote line-lengths to use iterative instead of really complicated
   functional approach.  Saved maybe 5% on time.  Still complex, but 
   more understandable and slightly faster.

 * Added performance optimization `:hang-avoid` in `:list` which will
   not even bother to try a hang if lots left to do and very close to
   the right margin.  Didn't change output of anything tested or 
   zprint code itself, but saved up to 30% on very pessimal functions.
   Not so much on normal functions, but still a win for those tough
   ones.

 * Added two new styles: `:no-hang` and `:all-hang`, to allow configuring
   zprint without hangs or with hangs.  While I think that code formatted
   without hangs looks rather unlovely, some folks find the way it looks
   to be a worthwhile tradeoff for speedier performance without hangs,
   particularly in Clojurescript.  So, now, you can configure that easily
   one way or the other.

### Fixed

 * Fixed bug in configuration where `:parallel?` wasn't being set to
   true even for repl use (or in lein zprint).  Saved up to 20% in
   lein zprint, which is actually quite a bit.

## 0.4.6 - 2018-1-10

### Changed

 * Added `{:vector {:respect-nl? true}}` support, so that hand-formatted
   vectors can be preserved on ouput.

 * Added `{:vector {:option-fn-first #()}}`, which allows definition
   of a function to be called with the first element of every vector,
   and returns an options map to be used to format that vector and
   all that it contains.  Added primarily to allow targetted use
   of `:respect-nl?`, but is fully general and can certainly be used
   to enable other capabilities.

 * Added new style `:keyword-respect-nl`, which will use the two new
   capabilities above to preserve existing newlines in vectors that
   start with a keyword (as hiccup and rum HTML data do).

 * Extended `zprint-file-str` to accept an options map.  
 
 * Added `zprint-file` and `zprint-file-str` to the external API, and
   documented the use of `;!zprint` directives in the zprint readme.
   (It was already documented in the lein-zprint readme.)

 * Added tests for `zprint-file-str`, which previously was only tested
   by lein-zprint.

### Fixed

 * Additionally, changed `zprint-file-str` to leave the configured options 
   unchanged after processing.  It used to leave them around after processing
   to be retrieved with `(get-options)`, possibly distorting the next call
   to any zprint function. 

## 0.4.5 - 2017-12-9

### Changed

 * Added support for `rum` macros `defc`, `defcc`, and `defcs`,
   using `:arg1-mixin` function tag.  See the readme for details
   of what this looks like.  Issue #41.

 * Add `swap!` as `:arg2`, and `with-redefs-fn` as `:arg1-body`.

## 0.4.4 - 2017-10-26

### Changed

 * Added :color? boolean to options map, which will allow you to select
   color (or not) regardless of whether or not you use czprint or zprint.

 * Added `deftest` and `defexpect` as `:arg1-body` functions in the 
   `fn-map`.

### Fixed

 * Added inline-comment support, on by default.  Controlled by {:comment
   {:inline? true}}.  They will also be wrapped. Issue #33.

 * Fixed problem with focus interacting badly with comment wrapping,
   where a wrapped comment would change the path for later elements
   if it wrapped.  Now wrapping is performed after all focus operations
   are completed.

## 0.4.3 - 2017-10-10

### Changed

* Added support for focus on output.  This allows you to input
  an expression parsed with rewrite-clj and point at some expression
  down inside of the overall expression, and get that printed with
  "focus" (currently a rather garish reverse-video, but that will
  probably become configurable in the fullness of time).

* Added support for outputing only some lines from printing an
  expression, and replacing them with a configurable string to
  indicate an elision.  Documentation on this is coming but not
  here yet.

* Upgraded support to Clojure 1.9-beta2 and Clojurescript 1.9.946.

* Upgraded rewrite-clj to 0.6.0.

* Added `:syntax-quote-paren` to the `:color-map` and the `:uneval` 
  `:color-map`.  By default this turns the parens `:red` inside of
  syntax-quoted expressions.

* Made `assoc-in` and `doto` both be `:arg1` functions.

### Fixed

* Fixed a bug where an `:arg2*` function which wasn't able to
  hang-one threw an exception.  Pretty rare, needs a very deeply
  nested function.  `cgrand/poucet` did manage to expose this
  problem.

* Map with long keys and `:justify?` true does not become justified.
  It is worth noting that `:justify?` also has a heuristic aspect,
  where if the justification takes more width than is available it
  will fall back to unjustified.  But this also exposed a bug where
  the handling of the width didn't work in situations were you
  turned off commas.  This is now fixed.  Issue #31.

* zprint nil prints a blank line, not nil.  Issue #32.

* The latest versions of lumo and planck both have upgraded to
  tools.reader 1.0.5.  Unfortunately, rewrite-cljs 0.4.3 depended
  on an internal API for tools.reader that changed from the alpha
  version used by rewrite-cljs 0.4.3, but we've gotten a new version,
  rewrite-cljs 0.4.4, which now works with tools.reader 1.0.5, so
  both planck 2.8.1 and lumo 1.8-beta now work again with zprint.
  Issue #30.

## 0.4.2 - 2017-6-22

### Changed

* Changed printing of `:pair-fn` functions (i.e. `cond`) so that if
  there is more than one pair (and if there weren't, why would you
  use a cond), it won't print it all on one line.  If you don't
  like this, `{:remove {:fn-gt2-force-nl #{:pair-fn}}}` will turn
  it off.

* Added ability to lift namespaces out of maps with namespaced keys.
  Controlled by `:lift-ns?` and `:lift-ns-in-code?` in `:map`.  Will
  not lift namespaces when specified implicitly in strings.  That is,
  will not try to figure out correct namespace for `::a`, since when
  parsing a file this can't reliably be known.  Note that `#::{}` maps
  are not currently supported, and cannot be handled when using the
  `:parse-string? true` input approach.

### Fixed

* A `:>>` in a `condp` wasn't handled correctly (i.e., at all).  This
  made the pairing up of `condp` clauses all wrong after that.

* A problem when using a "modifier" in an `:extend` (e.g., "static" in
  `defui`) -- the modifier and the thing after it were always formatted
  onto the same line, even if they didn't fit.  Now, if they don't fit
  together, they don't end up on the same line. 

## 0.4.1 - 2017-5-18

### Changed

* Added capability to pass options map to zprint-filter by changing
  the zprint.main namespace to handle a null string, and changing
  appcds script to create a slightly different script.

* Moved to `cljs.spec.alpha` for Clojurescript too.  Zprint now requires
  Clojurescript 1.9.542 or later.

* It is now not even accept to set `:parallel?` to `true` in Clojurescript,
  as the spec has been changed to consider this an error when you try it.

* Added new capability: sorting for sets.  Similar to maps, now
  {:set {:sort? true :sort-in-code? false}} is the default.  When
  you have sets with a lot in them, it is nice to see them sorted.

* Added new capability: key-value-color for maps.  Where key-color colors a
  particular key that matches the color that you specify, key-value-color
  will also match a key, but instead of affecting the color of that key,
  it merges in a color-map which is the value of that key into the current
  color-map, affecting the printing of everything in the value.  Which
  may be a constant like a string or a keyword, but might be an entire
  complex expression.  This only works for maps.

* Removed `{:pair {:indent 0}}` from the `:spec` style.  If you like your
  pairs non-indented, feel free to add it to the style yourself.
  Put this: `{:style-map {:spec {:pair {:indent 0}}}}` in your
  `~/.zprintrc`.

### Fixed

* Fixed Issue #27, where missing function errors came up when using
  zprint in non-self-hosted Clojurescript.

* `czprint-fn` will now print specs for any function that has them.
  It will add them to the end of the doc-string (much like `doc`
  will do, but it will also pretty print them).
  In particular, try `let` or `ns` or even `defn`.  The `defn` ones
  are a little funky, as the indent isn't all that lovely.

## 0.4.0 - 2017-5-5

### Changed

* Changed to use `clojure.spec.alpha` instead of `clojure.spec`.
  Now, the 0.4.0 version runs in 1.9-alpha16, but not 1.9-alpha15.
  It still runs in 1.8 as well, but requires a different supporing
  library -- see the readme.

### Fixed

* Issue #26 -- now it runs in 1.9-alpha16.

## 0.3.3 - 2017-5-4

### Changed

* Added `appcds` script to set up zprint-filter with less opportunity
  for errors. 

* Added instructions for how to use zprint-filter with `emacs` and
  Sublime Text 2 or 3.

* Changed default for `:extend` to `{:flow? true}`, to fix issues in 
  `extend-protocol`, `reify`, and `extend` where things were coming out
  on the same line when they should not.

* Created `:arg2-extend` to better handle `deftype` and `defrecord`.

* Changed fn-type of `defprotocol` to `:arg1-force-nl`, so that it doesn't
  hang several small forms.

### Fixed

* Issue #25, where additional () were added when formatting a `(fn ...)`
  when the `(fn ...)` was in a Clojure data structure.  This didn't happen
  when formatting source in files or with the zprint-filter.

## 0.3.2 - 2017-4-18

### Changed

### Fixed

* Issue #23, where (czprint-fn defn {:style :justified}) would not
  produce any output.  This bug was added in 0.3.0.

* More work on dependencies to make it easier to release.

## 0.3.1 - 2017-4-10

### Fixed

* Fixed dependencies so that `[clojure-future-spec "1.9.0-alpha15"]`
  is actually required to use zprint on Clojure 1.8, and doesn't 
  get brought along into usage on 1.9 by default.

## 0.3.0 - 2017-4-9

### Changed

* __DEPRECATED__ configuration from environment variables and Java system
  properties.  Still available by adding a library to your dependencies.
  File an issue if you care about this!

* __DEPRECATED__ :auto-width capability.  Still available by adding a library to your dependencies.  File an issue if you care about this!

* Added zprint-filter uberjar and documentation.  Uberjar is available as
  a "release" on Github.

* Moved to clojure.spec for all versions, requiring a single additional
  library when using Clojure 1.8.

* Added futures to fzprint-hang-remaining, helped a lot.

* Used pmap to handle two-up generation, helped a lot.

* Added transient to some vectors being built.  Sometimes it helped, somtimes
  it didn't.  Kept the ones where it helped. 

### Fixed

* Dates in this file.

## 0.2.16 - 2017-2-27

### Changed

* Added zprint.lumo namespace to support zprint filter.  Only used when
  initiated by lumo.

* Added zprint.planck namespace to support zprint filter.  Only used when
  initiated by plank.
  
* Replaced function-by-function destructuring with with-redefs in both
  zutil.cljc and sutil.cljs.  Added new namespace zfns to make this work.
  Resulted in small but significant speedup.

* Major changes to Clojurescript port -- removed Prismatic/Plumatic Schema
  and replaced it with spec for checking options maps.  Refactored option
  map validation into two additional namespaces.  Now zprint will work
  in self-hosted Clojurescript, and we are ready for a complete move to
  spec when we can require 1.9.

## 0.2.15 - 2017-1-24

### Changed

* Added `{:map {:key-color {:key1 :color1 :key2 :color2 ...}}}` which will color the specified
  keys with the specified color.

* Added `{:map {:key-depth-color [:level-1-color :level-2-color ...]}}`, which
  will color the map keys based on depth, not their type.  The
  `:key-color {:key :color ...}` map will override any values from the 
  `:key-depth-color` map.  EXPERIMENTAL feature, might go away.

## 0.2.14 - 2017-1-22

### Changed

* Added a new capability to `:extend`, `:modfiers #{"static"}`, which
  will allow "static" to appear on the same line as protocol or type
  when formatting extends.  You remove elements from the set  with 
  `{:remove {:extend {:modifiers #{"static"}}}}` just like the other 
  sets are changed.  Issue #10.

* Added `defui` to the `:fn-map` as `:arg1-extend` so that when formatting
  Clojurescript om/next code you get the `static` elements to format 
  correctly.  Issue #10.

* Added several new styles: `:map-nl`, `:binding-nl`, `:pair-nl`.  Also
  added substantially to the documentation of styles in the readme.

* Added the first tests for the `:explain` output, at least the `:value`
  part of it.

### Fixed

* A problem when adding an element to any set in the options map, where the
  element was added, but the :explain output was incorrect.  Issue #21.

## 0.2.13 - 2017-1-19

### Changed

* Added support for `:hang?` in `:extend`, so that you can control
  whether or not the function definitions end up formatting as a
  hang after the type.  `:hang?` defaults to `true` (and this is
  not a change), but can now be turned off to force a flow.  Note
  that if a type and function defnition all fit on one line, that
  `:hang? false` will not affect it.  If you want them on separate
  lines you need to use `:flow? true`, which will override the normal
  desire to print things on one line.

* Altered the meaning of :nl-separator?.  In its initial release it
  would place an extra new-line whenever a pair took more than one line.
  Now, it only places an extra new-line when the pair did an actual
  flow, so that a multi-line hang does not trigger an extra new-line.
  The previous capability would be easy to add if there is any
  interest in doing that.

* Added the ability to set multiple styles at once, with a sequence
  of style keywords instead of just a single keyword.  Also added
  some great style tests.  Go expectations!

### Fixed

* The new `:nl-separator?` capability does not work right with lists
  that have constant-pairs at the end but regular s-expressions earlier.
  If the earlier s-expressions take more than one line, then they get
  blank lines below them which is wrong from several different perspectives.
  Now multiple line s-expressions don't ever trigger blank lines, since
  the `:nl-separator?` blank lines are triggered by a pair with the right
  hand part of the pair being formatted with a flow. Issue #17.

## 0.2.12 - 2017-1-9

### Fixed

* Accepted pull request to change function style for "ns" to `:arg1-body`.
  Thanks to pesterhazy!

* Accepted pull request to change function "!=" to "not=".  Thanks to
  mynomoto!

## 0.2.11 - 2017-1-8

### Changed

* Removed `:indent n` from `:pair-fn`, as it wasn't used.

* Changed `cond` and `alt` to be `:pair-fn`, and not `:pair`, since
  `:pair` was supposed to not be a function style on its own, but a
  configuration element for functions that have pairs in them, like
  `:arg1-pair` and `:pair-fn`.

* Added capability to produce blank lines after pairs where the second element
  of the pair doesn't fit on the same line as the first.  The options key
  for this is `:nl-separator?`, and is by default false for all occurances
  of this configuration option.  It is supported for `:map`, `:extend`,
  `:binding`, and `:pair` formatting.  This was requested for `:map`, but
  the implementation also allows configuring `:extend` to produce a commonly
  used format as well. Issue #12.

* Added `:flow?` options key for `:map`, `:extend`, `:binding`, and `:pair`.
  By default false for all.  When enabled, this will cause the second
  element of every pair to be formatted on the line after the first element,
  thus acting line a "flow".  See the readme for differences between
  `:flow?`, `:hang?`, `:force-nl?`, and `:nl-separator?`.  This was
  largely added to work together with `:nl-separator?` in `:extend`, but
  also has uses elsewhere.  `:flow?` will override the indent checks in
  when printing things two up, so that it will force a flow even though
  the first element of the pair is so short that it doesn't make any
  sense.  Just because it is so confusing if it doesn't do that.

### Fixed

* Fixed constant pairs to be formatted under control of the configuration
  for `:pair`, which now includes `:flow?` and `:nl-separator?`.

* Serious bug where whitespace after left parenthesis causes either the 
  first or second element in a list to be repeated if the list doesn't fit
  entirely on one line.  Issue #16.


## 0.2.10 - 2016-12-23

### Changed

* Added two new sets in the config, :fn-gt2-force-nl and :fn-gt3-force-nl
  into which you can put fn-styles so that they will never print on the
  same line even if they could.  The gt2 is if it has greater than 2 args
  and the gt3 is likewise if it has greater than 3 args.  Issue #3.

* Refactored `zprint-file`, pulling out `zprint-file-str` so that boot-fmt
  can use it.  Added `zprint-file-str` to the API.  Issue #7.

* Added `:arg2-fn` to support proxy.

* Added `:arg1-force-nl` to support `s/def`.  Put several additional
  spec functions into the `:fn-map` so that spec files now pretty nicely.

* Added experimental options to try to speed up map printing at the
  repl, which slows down when the maps are really deeply nested.
  `:max-hang-span`
  `:max-hang-depth`
  `:max-hang-count`
  These are experimental, and will probably not keep their current names
  or location in the options map.  They are not documented.  Do not 
  depend on them.

* Added `:flow` and `:flow-body` to force some functions to never hang.
  Largely added for `:require` in `ns` declarations.  Issue #5.

* Added `:require` to the `:fn-map` as `:force-nl-body` so that it will
  hang all of the requires.  If you want it to pull them 
  all over to the left and not even have something on the same line as
  the `:require`, define it as `:flow-body`.  Issue #2.

### Fixed

* Added a capability to remove elements from a set, now that sets in
  the config are more common.   Also, fixed it so that you can specify
  additional members for a set, and they will be merged into the set,
  instead of replacing the entire set.  Issue #4.

* Fixed `:fn-force-nl` to accurately match the function type, and not
  do it after the `-body` has been removed.  Issue #6.

* A bug in `:arg1-extend` where, when used for `proxy`, some of the function
  was getting dropped and not output.  Since `proxy` was not defined as
  `:arg1-extend`, this is not as serious as it might seem, but it was not
  good.

## 0.2.9 - 2016-11-13

### Changed

* Added :force-nl and :force-nl-body along with :fn-force-nl set in
  configuration to force some functions to never format onto the same
  line.  Primarily for -> and ->> and other similar functions where
  most people want to see them listed vertically, not on the same line.

* Made keywords format as functions, since they are.  This cleans up
  ns declarations a bit at the start of files.
  
### Fixed

## 0.2.8 - 2016-11-9

### Changed

* Added documentation on experimental features: auto-width, max-length,
  max-depth.

### Fixed

* Fixed bug in handling of :left-space :keep and :drop which involved a 
  complete rework of options map handling in process-multiple-forms
  and zprint-str-internal and czprint-str-internal.  Should have fixed
  a number of other not yet encountered bugs.
* Fixed issue in fzprint-hang-remaining where if the hang-expand value was
  exceeded it wouldn't bother to hang.  Which interacted badly with the
  hang-if-equal-flow? capability.  Added test to ensure this stays fixed.
* Fixed bug where if the first element of a pair was a map that got a 
  comma, and the second element of the pair ended up with a hang, the 
  first line of the hang would have the wrong indent because the size of
  the first element of the pair was calculated incorrectly.
* Fixed a bug where :map {:comma? false} didn't actually work if the map
  fit on one line.  Worked fine for multi-line maps, not one line ones.

## 0.2.7 - 2016-11-1

### Changed

* Changed hang-expand to 4.0 most everywhere
* Changed fn-map of -> to :none-body, and catch to :arg2
* Considerable changes to support Clojurescript.  All files now .cljc
* Added {:file {:left-space :keep}} or :drop to handle spaces on the
  left of function definitions.
* {:parse-string? true} will always trim spaces off of what is being parsed.
* (:parse-string-all? true} will parse multiple forms in one string.  This
  does not support ;!zprint {<options-map>} comments.

### Fixed

* Fixed bug where -> affected :arg1 status of more than immediate args
* Fixed issue #1 with incorrect indent on 3rd arg to (fn ...)

## 0.2.6 - 2016-10-10

### Changed

* Changes to support :reader-cond {:force-nl? boolean}
* Added defrecord to function categorization.

## 0.2.5 - 2016-10-06

### Changed

* Changed heuristics so that if hang and flow take the same number of
lines, then it will hang.  Can be adjusted with tuning.

## 0.2.4 - 2016-10-05

### Changed

* Reworked README.md, internal TOC, added information about several
existing capabilities.  Alphabetized the configurable elements.

## 0.2.3 - 2016-10-01

### Changed

* Removed `:list {:indent-body n}`, made it `:indent`.  Made `:indent-arg`
optional, uses `:indent` if it doesn't appear.
* Added `:support` keyword (replaced undocumented `:explain-all`).
* Added documentation for `:justify?` in readme.
* Added `:key-ignore` and `:key-ignore-silent` for `:map` formatting.
* Added `:to-string?` for `:record` formatting.

### Removed

* Removed (get-options) from zprint.core, took need for it out of readme.

### Fixed

* A problem where the last newline in a file was getting lost.
* A problem where a comment inside of a fn starting in col 0 was getting
an extra newline.

## 0.2.2 - 2016-09-24
### Changed

* Straighten out core and config namespaces for API
* Added :old? and :format to options map for lein-zprint

## 0.2.1 - 2016-09-22
### Changed

* Moved some configuration functions into zprint.core to match readme.
* Put ALPHA banner in readme.

* Fixed a bug where it wouldn't configure if no ~/.zprintrc file.

## 0.2.0 - 2016-09-21
### Added
- Initial project commit.
