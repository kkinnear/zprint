# zprint

__zprint__ is a library and command line tool providing a variety
of pretty printing capabilities for both Clojure code and Clojure/EDN
structures.  It can meet almost anyone's needs.  As such, it supports
a number of major source code formattng approaches.

### *Recent Additions!* 

 * You can alias function formatting in the `:fn-map`.  If the value in
 the `:fn-map` is a string, then the formatting for that function is used.
 This makes having one function format like another much easier to configure.
 * Hiccup or HTML output now available!  Library `-str` fns and prebuilt
 binaries support `{:output {:format :hiccup}}` and `{:output {:format :html}}`.
 EXPERIMENTAL for now --  as always, please let me know of any issues.
 * The library is now thread-safe (only if you format all strings or all
 structures.  You can't intermix them simultaneously.)
 * Tests now also run in babaska (thanks to @borkdude)
 * Tested with Clojure `1.11.1`, Clojurescript `1.11.4`
 * Implemented `{:output {:range? true}}` to ease integration with IDE's.
 * New version of rewrite-clj now used for both .clj and .cljs.  Many thanks to
 @lread for picking up support and extensions for rewrite-clj and merging 
 rewrite-cljs with it to create a unified Clojure parsing library.  This
 will fix a number of bugs that were parser related.
 * You can now format values in maps differently, based on the key with
 which a value is associated.  `{:map {:key-value-options {key-1 options-map-1 
 key-2 options-map-2 ...}}` lets you specify an options map to be used 
 for formatting the value of any specific key in any map.  
 * A number of new styles: `:ns-justify`, which will nicely format `ns` macros.
 `:quote-wrap` which will cause a quoted list to wrap, and not format each item
 running down the page, to mention a few.
 * A more nuanced approach to justification, based on the variance of the lengths of the left-hand elements in a binding vector, map, or cond.  If the variance is too great, up to two pairs are left out of the justification.  If that doesn't bring the variance into line, none of the pairs are justified.  `{:style :justified}` to try it out!
 * The `are` macro is now formatted readably by default.
 * [In-place formatting by file name](./doc/using/files.md), `$ zprint -w file.clj` and `$ zprint -w *.clj`
 * [Check formatting of files without altering them](./doc/using/files.md), using `-c` or `--check`: `$ zprint -c *.clj`.
 * [Functions in options maps now safely supported in all `.zprintrc` files using any distributed binaries, using `sci`.](./doc/options/optionfns.md) 
 * [You can now define a style and use it in the same `.zprintrc`.](./doc/reference.md#style-and-style-map)  You can also define one style in terms of another.
 * Output colorized, formatted source to terminal: `$ zprint '{:color? true}' <file.clj`
 * [Format babashka scripts](./doc/using/babashka.md)
 * [Format ranges of lines in files](./doc/using/range.md)
 * [{`:style :dark-color-map`} when using dark terminals](./doc/reference.md#dark-color-map)
 * [All changes](./CHANGELOG.md)

## See zprint:

  * [__classic zprint__](./doc/types/classic.md) -- ignores whitespace 
  in function definitions and formats code with a variety of heuristics 
  to look as good as hand-formatted code 
  ([_see examples_](./doc/types/classic.md))
  * [__respect blank lines__](./doc/types/respectbl.md) -- similar to 
  classic zprint, but blank lines inside of function defintions are retained, 
  while code is otherwise formatted to look beautiful
  ([_see examples_](./doc/types/respectbl.md))
  * [__indent only__](./doc/types/indentonly.md) -- very different from 
  classic zprint -- no code ever changes lines, it is only correctly 
  indented on whatever line it was already on
  ([_see examples_](./doc/types/indentonly.md))

In addition, zprint is very handy [__to use at the REPL__](./doc/types/repl.md).

## Use zprint:

  * [to format whole files](./doc/using/files.md)
  * [while using an editor](./doc/using/editor.md)
  * [at the REPL](./doc/using/repl.md)
  * [with a team](./doc/using/team.md)
  * [with different formatting for different projects](./doc/using/project.md)
  * [to format a range of lines in a file](./doc/using/range.md)
  * [to format a babashka script](./doc/using/babashka.md)
  * [to correct indentation but not otherwise reformat a file](./doc/using/indent.md)
  * [and have it run even faster](./doc/using/fasthang.md)
  * [from inside a Clojure(script) program](./doc/using/library.md)

## Get zprint:

  * [a standalone binary for Linux](./doc/getting/linux.md)    _starts in <50 ms_

  * [other ways to access zprint](./doc/getting/other.md)

## Get something other than the default formatting:

### Without learning how to configure zprint:

Maybe one of the existing "styles" will meet your needs.  All you have to
do is put `{:style ...}` on the command line or as the third argument
to a zprint call.  For example, `{:style :community}` or 
`{:style :respect-bl}`.

Some commonly used styles:

  * [Format using "community" standards](./doc/reference.md#community)
  * [Respect blank lines](./doc/reference.md#respect-bl)
  * [Indent Only](./doc/reference.md#indent-only)
  * [Respect all newlines](./doc/reference.md#respect-nl)
  * [Detect and format hiccup vectors](./doc/reference.md#hiccup)
  * [Justify all pairs](./doc/reference.md#justified)
  * [Backtranslate `quote`, `deref`, `var`, `unquote` in structures](./doc/reference.md#backtranslate)
  * [Detect keywords in vectors, if found respect newlines](./doc/reference.md#keyword-respect-nl)
  * [Sort dependencies in project.clj](./doc/reference.md#sort-dependencies)
  * [Support "How to ns"](./doc/reference.md#how-to-ns)

## Learn how to alter zprint's formatting behavior:

  * [How do I change zprint's behavior?](./doc/altering.md)

### I want to change...

  * [how user defined functions are formatted](./doc/options/fns.md)
  * [the indentation in lists](./doc/options/indent.md)
  * [the configuration to track the "community" standard](./doc/options/community.md)
  * [how blank lines in source are handled](./doc/options/blank.md)
  * [how map keys are formatted](./doc/options/maps.md)
  * [the colors used for formatting source](./doc/options/colors.md)
  * [how the second element of a pair is indented](./doc/options/pairs.md)
  * [how comments are handled](./doc/options/comments.md)
  * [how blank lines are handled at the top level](./doc/options/toplevel.md)
  * [how vectors are formatted based on their content](./doc/options/vectors.md)
  * [how constants are defined when formatting constant pairs](./doc/options/constantpairs.md)
  * [the options map by defining functions to format based on content](./doc/options/optionfns.md)
  * [anything else...](./doc/reference.md#introduction-to-configuration)

## Usage

[![cljdoc badge](https://cljdoc.org/badge/zprint/zprint)](https://cljdoc.org/d/zprint/zprint/CURRENT)

### Clojure 1.9, 1.10, 1.10.3, 1.11.1:

__Leiningen ([via Clojars](http://clojars.org/zprint))__

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/zprint.svg)](https://clojars.org/zprint)

### Clojurescript:

zprint has been tested in each of the following environments:

  * figwheel-main 0.2.16 (Clojurescript 1.11.4)
  * shadow-cljs 2.18.0
  * `planck` 2.26.0 (Clojurescript 1.10.914)

It requires `tools.reader` at least 1.0.5, which all of the environments
above contain.

### Clojure 1.8:

The last zprint release built with Clojure 1.8 was [zprint "0.4.15"].

In addition to the zprint dependency, you also need to
include the following library when using Clojure 1.8:

```
[clojure-future-spec "1.9.0-alpha17"]
```

### Acknowledgements

At the core of `zprint` is the `rewrite-clj` library originally
created by Yannick Scherer, ported to Clojurescript by Magnus
Rundberget, and recently merged into a single, supported, documented,
and updated library by Lee Read.  This is a great library!  I would not have
attempted `zprint` if `rewrite-clj` didn't exist to build upon.

Additionally, allowing options maps containing functions to be read
from files safely is made possible by `sci`, the Small Clojure Interpreter
by Michael Borkent (@borkdude).  This is a very well designed and
implemented addition to Clojure that required almost no effort to integrate
into zprint.
