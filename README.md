# zprint

__zprint__ is a library and command line tool providing a variety
of pretty printing capabilities for both Clojure code and Clojure/EDN
structures.  It can meet almost anyone's needs.  As such, it supports
a number of major source code formatting approaches.

[![cljdoc badge](https://cljdoc.org/badge/zprint/zprint)](https://cljdoc.org/d/zprint/zprint/CURRENT)

### Quickstart

  * Latest pre-compiled binaries for macOS and Linux are [here on GitHub](https://github.com/kkinnear/zprint/releases/latest)  
  * Run the same code [in babashka](doc/getting/babashka.md) [![bb compatible](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/babashka/babashka/master/logo/badge.svg)](https://babashka.org)
  * Library to use [in the REPL](doc/using/repl.md) or embed in your project: [![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/zprint.svg)](https://clojars.org/zprint)    

### Overview

**zprint** does far more than just properly indent code.  **Before**:

```clojure
(defn change-start-column [new-start-column style-vec [inline-comment-index
  start-column spaces-before :as comment-vec]] (if (zero? inline-comment-index)
  style-vec (let [delta-spaces (- new-start-column start-column) new-spaces
  (+ spaces-before delta-spaces) previous-element-index (dec
  inline-comment-index) [s c e :as previous-element] (nth style-vec
  previous-element-index) new-previous-element (cond (= e :indent) [(str "\n"
  (blanks new-spaces)) c e] (= e :whitespace) [(str (blanks new-spaces))
  c e 26] :else nil)] (assoc style-vec previous-element-index
  new-previous-element))))
```

**After**:

```clojure
(defn change-start-column
  [new-start-column style-vec
   [inline-comment-index start-column spaces-before :as comment-vec]]
  (if (zero? inline-comment-index)
    style-vec
    (let [delta-spaces (- new-start-column start-column)
          new-spaces (+ spaces-before delta-spaces)
          previous-element-index (dec inline-comment-index)
          [s c e :as previous-element] (nth style-vec previous-element-index)
          new-previous-element
            (cond (= e :indent) [(str "\n" (blanks new-spaces)) c e]
                  (= e :whitespace) [(str (blanks new-spaces)) c e 26]
                  :else nil)]
      (assoc style-vec previous-element-index new-previous-element))))
```

### *Recent Additions!* 


  * A new style, `:sort-require`, will sort the requires in an `ns` macro, 
  as suggested by 
  [how-to-ns](https://stuartsierra.com/2016/clojure-how-to-ns.html).
  This will interoperate with `:ns-justify` well, but be sure and put
  the `:sort-require` to the left of (i.e., before) the `:ns-justify`.
  This will sort the elements of the `:refer` vector as well.
  * `:ns-justify` has been modified to support explicit parameters
  for the variance in the `:require`, `:require-macros` and `:import`
  sections of the `ns` macro.  They are `:require-max-variance`,
  `:require-macros-max-variance` and `:import-max-variance` and may
  be used in a style map.  For example `{:style-call :ns-justify
  :require-max-variance 1000}` will try as hard as possible to justify
  the `:require` list in an `ns` macro.
  * A new pre-compiled binary is available for macOS running on Apple 
  Silicon.  While the macOS Intel binary runs fine on Apple Silicon, the
  Apple Silicon binary runs considerably (up to 3x) faster!  Download
  `zprintma-1.2.9` from the release to get the Apple Silicon version.
  * You can now run zprint as a babashka task or use `bbin`.
  It starts very quickly and runs faster than the uberjar on even very 
  large files.  If using a task,  you don't need to install a new version, 
  just edit `bb.edn`.  See the simple detals [here](./doc/getting/babashka.md)
  * Important updates and fixes for comment wrapping changes first
  available in `1.2.6`. Avoid `1.2.6`, use `1.2.7` or later. 
  * Comment wrapping has been considerably altered.  When working
  on the stability fixes for `1.2.5`, the largest remaining problem
  was comment wrapping causing changes to the formatting in subsequent
  runs.  In addition, the comment wrapping has been very simplistic
  since its inception, leaving wrapped comments looking pretty bad.
  There is a new capability called `{:comment {:smart-wrap? true}}`
  which will now word wrap comments cleanly.  It will also repair
  most of the problems that the simplistic wrapping produced in the
  past.  It is now the default, in no small part to repair the
  problems of the past.  If you are working to minimize changes
  when running zprint, I would recommend running it once over your
  code before you disable it, as will clean up most of the problems
  that were added by zprint in the past.  You can disable it with
  `{:comment {:smart-wrap? false}}`.  You can also configure it to
  minimize the amount of word wrapping it does, while still allowing
  it to do much better than the previous default by using `{:style
  :minimal-smart-wrap}`.  You need to have `{:comment {:smart-wrap?
  true}}` to use `:minimal-smart-wrap`.  Smart wrap works hard to
  not wrap things like numbered or bulleted lists.  If you have a
  case where it wraps something that it shouldn't, please submit an
  issue. It is likely that it can be fixed with a configuration
  change. See the reference manual for more details on how to
  configure smart wrap.
  * You can now specify some keys to come last in a map as well as
  some keys to appear first in a sorted map.  The `{:map {:key-order [...]}}`
  configuration places all of the keys prior to the distinguished key
  `:|` at the front of the map, and all of the keys after the `:|` key
  at the end of the map.  
  * [All changes](./CHANGELOG.md)

## See zprint:

  * [__classic zprint__](./doc/types/classic.md) -- ignores whitespace 
  in function definitions and formats code with a variety of heuristics 
  to look as good as hand-formatted code 
  ([_see examples_](./doc/types/classic.md))
  * [__respect blank lines__](./doc/types/respectbl.md) -- similar to 
  classic zprint, but blank lines inside of function defintions are retained, 
  while code is otherwise formatted to look beautiful
  ([_see examples_](./doc/types/respectbl.md))
  * [__indent only__](./doc/types/indentonly.md) -- very different from 
  classic zprint -- no code ever changes lines, it is only correctly 
  indented on whatever line it was already on
  ([_see examples_](./doc/types/indentonly.md))

In addition, zprint is very handy [__to use at the REPL__](./doc/types/repl.md).

## Use zprint:

  * [to format whole files](./doc/using/files.md)
  * [while using an editor](./doc/using/editor.md)
  * [at the REPL](./doc/using/repl.md)
  * [with a team](./doc/using/team.md)
  * [with different formatting for different projects](./doc/using/project.md)
  * [to format a range of lines in a file](./doc/using/range.md)
  * [to format a babashka script](./doc/using/babashka.md)
  * [to correct indentation but not otherwise reformat a file](./doc/using/indent.md)
  * [and have it run even faster](./doc/using/fasthang.md)
  * [from inside a Clojure(script) program](./doc/using/library.md)

## Get zprint:

  * [a standalone binary for macOS](./doc/getting/macos.md)    _starts in <50 ms_
  * [a standalone binary for Linux](./doc/getting/linux.md)    _starts in <50 ms_
  * [a VS Code extension for zprint](./doc/getting/vscode.md)
  * [using babashka](./doc/getting/babashka.md)
  * [an uberjar for any Java enabled platform](./doc/getting/uberjar.md)    _starts in several seconds_
  * [an accelerated uberjar for any Java enabled platform](./doc/getting/appcds.md)    _starts in about 1s_
  * [a library to use at the REPL](./doc/using/repl.md)
  * [other ways to access zprint](./doc/getting/other.md)

## Get something other than the default formatting:

### Without learning how to configure zprint:

Maybe one of the existing "styles" will meet your needs.  All you have to
do is put `{:style ...}` on the command line or as the third argument
to a zprint call.  For example, `{:style :community}` or 
`{:style :respect-bl}`.

Some commonly used styles:

  * [Format using "community" standards](./doc/reference.md#community)
  * [Respect blank lines](./doc/reference.md#respect-bl)
  * [Indent Only](./doc/reference.md#indent-only)
  * [Respect all newlines](./doc/reference.md#respect-nl)
  * [Detect and format hiccup vectors](./doc/reference.md#hiccup)
  * [Justify all pairs](./doc/reference.md#justified)
  * [Backtranslate `quote`, `deref`, `var`, `unquote` in structures](./doc/reference.md#backtranslate)
  * [Detect keywords in vectors, if found respect newlines](./doc/reference.md#keyword-respect-nl)
  * [Sort dependencies in project.clj](./doc/reference.md#sort-dependencies)
  * [Support "How to ns"](./doc/reference.md#how-to-ns)

## Learn how to alter zprint's formatting behavior:

  * [How do I change zprint's behavior?](./doc/altering.md)

### I want to change...

  * [how user defined functions are formatted](./doc/options/fns.md)
  * [the indentation in lists](./doc/options/indent.md)
  * [the configuration to track the "community" standard](./doc/options/community.md)
  * [how blank lines in source are handled](./doc/options/blank.md)
  * [how map keys are formatted](./doc/options/maps.md)
  * [the colors used for formatting source](./doc/options/colors.md)
  * [how the second element of a pair is indented](./doc/options/pairs.md)
  * [how comments are handled](./doc/options/comments.md)
  * [how blank lines are handled at the top level](./doc/options/toplevel.md)
  * [how vectors are formatted based on their content](./doc/options/vectors.md)
  * [how constants are defined when formatting constant pairs](./doc/options/constantpairs.md)
  * [the options map by defining functions to format based on content](./doc/options/optionfns.md)
  * [anything else...](./doc/reference.md#introduction-to-configuration)

### Clojurescript:

zprint has been tested in each of the following environments:

  * figwheel-main 0.2.16 (Clojurescript 1.11.4)
  * shadow-cljs 2.18.0
  * `planck` 2.27.0 (Clojurescript 1.11.60)

It requires `tools.reader` at least 1.0.5, which all of the environments
above contain.

### Clojure 1.8:

The last zprint release built with Clojure 1.8 was [zprint "0.4.15"].

In addition to the zprint dependency, you also need to
include the following library when using Clojure 1.8:

```clojure
[clojure-future-spec "1.9.0-alpha17"]
```

### Acknowledgements

At the core of `zprint` is the `rewrite-clj` library originally
created by Yannick Scherer, ported to Clojurescript by Magnus
Rundberget, and recently merged into a single, supported, documented,
and updated library by Lee Read.  This is a great library!  I would not have
attempted `zprint` if `rewrite-clj` didn't exist to build upon.

Additionally, allowing options maps containing functions to be read
from files safely is made possible by `sci`, the Small Clojure Interpreter
by Michael Borkent (@borkdude).  This is a very well designed and
implemented addition to Clojure that required almost no effort to integrate
into zprint.
