;; ztype is an atom containing a vector with two elements:
;;
;; A keyword:
;;
;;   :zipper
;;   :structure
;;   :none
;;
;; An integer, representing the number of invocations of zprint
;; running at one time.
;;
;; All of this is to manage the zfns without using the binding
;; function, and it requires ^:dyanmic, which costs performance.
